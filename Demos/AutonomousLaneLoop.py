QCar Autonomous Driving Program - Front Camera Classification Model Integration
=========================================================================================

Description:
------------
This program controls the Quanser QCar in both manual and autonomous driving modes. 
It utilizes a front-facing camera for data collection and a pre-trained classification model 
to predict steering directions. The model outputs one of 17 distinct steering classes, 
which are then mapped to specific steering angles. The program supports both user-controlled 
manual driving and AI-driven autonomous mode.

Key Features:
-------------
1. **Manual Mode**: The user can control the car using the keyboard inputs (W, A, S, D).
2. **Autonomous Mode**: The QCar collects real-time camera images, processes them through 
   a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model, and adjusts its steering based on model predictions.
3. **LED Indicators**: The QCar uses LED signals to indicate turns, braking, and headlights.
4. **Throttle and Steering Control**: The car moves forward or backward with throttle adjustments,
   while steering is adjusted based on manual inputs or model predictions.
5. **Camera Support**: The program only uses the front camera (Camera ID = 3) for autonomous 
   driving and ignores other camera feeds.
6. **Model Loading**: The program loads a TFLite model from the "Models/" directory. 
   The model file path should be specified on line 45.

How It Works:
-------------
1. **Initializing the QCar**:
   - The QCar object is created with `readMode=0`, allowing control over the car's motors and sensors.
   - The pygame library is initialized to handle user inputs and display a control interface.

2. **Model Loading**:
   - A TensorFlow Lite model is loaded via `loadModel("Models/Feb25.tflite")`.
   - The model expects an input image and returns an array of probabilities for 17 steering classes.

3. **Driving Modes**:
   - The program starts in manual mode.
   - The user can switch between manual and autonomous modes using the following keys:
     - Press **M** for manual driving.
     - Press **N** for autonomous mode.

4. **Manual Driving Mode**:
   - The user can control the QCar using the keyboard:
     - **W**: Move forward.
     - **S**: Decelerate/Brake.
     - **A**: Steer left.
     - **D**: Steer right.
     - **R**: Engage reverse mode.
     - **F**: Switch back to forward mode.
     - **H**: Toggle headlights.

5. **Autonomous Driving Mode**:
   - The program continuously captures images from the front camera.
   - The image is preprocessed (converted to grayscale and cropped).
   - The image is sent to the TFLite model for classification.
   - The predicted steering class is mapped to a steering value.
   - The throttle is locked at **0.085** to maintain forward motion.
   - Steering is adjusted based on the modelâ€™s prediction.

6. **Camera Functions**:
   - `camPreview(camIDs=["front"])` captures an image from the front-facing camera.
   - The image is converted into the correct format for the model.
   - Other cameras (left, right, back) are initialized but not used.

7. **Stopping the Car**:
   - The program stops if the user closes the pygame window.
   - Pressing **Q** resets the throttle and steering to 0.

How to Use:
-----------
1. Place the desired **TFLite model** inside the `Models/` folder.
2. Modify the model path on **line 45** if necessary.
3. Run the program using: py3 AutonomousLaneLoop.py


4. Start in manual mode and use the **M** key to control manually.
5. Press **N** to switch to autonomous mode.
6. To stop the program, close the pygame window or press **Ctrl + C** in the terminal.

Dependencies:
-------------
Ensure the following libraries are installed before running the program:
- pygame
- tensorflow
- numpy
- opencv-python
- pal-utilities (Quanser QCar library)

Limitations:
------------
- The program only supports **classification models**.
- It **does not** use depth cameras or other sensor inputs.
- The **front camera** is the sole data input for the model.
- Throttle is **fixed** in autonomous mode for safety.
- The program assumes the **model outputs a single class prediction**.
